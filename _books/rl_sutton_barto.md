This book is widely considered the bible of Reinforcement Learning. It provides a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning.

**Key Topics Covered:**
*   **Tabular Methods:** Multi-armed bandits, Finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
*   **Dynamic Programming:** Policy evaluation, policy improvement, and policy iteration.
*   **Monte Carlo Methods:** Learning from experience without a model.
*   **Temporal-Difference Learning:** TD(0), Sarsa, Q-learning, and n-step bootstrapping.
*   **Approximation Methods:** Value function approximation, Policy Gradient methods (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic).

It serves as my primary reference for understanding the theoretical underpinnings of how agents learn to optimize rewards in complex environments.
