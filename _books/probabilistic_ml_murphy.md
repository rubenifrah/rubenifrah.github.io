This comprehensive textbook provides a unified probabilistic perspective on machine learning. It treats learning as inference, offering a coherent framework for understanding a vast array of models.

**Key Topics Covered:**
*   **Foundations:** Probability theory, Bayesian inference, and decision theory.
*   **Models:** Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Gaussian Processes.
*   **Graphical Models:** Directed and undirected graphs, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and state-space models.
*   **Deep Learning:** Deep generative models (VAEs, GANs) and their probabilistic interpretation.
*   **Inference:** Exact inference, variational inference, and Monte Carlo methods (MCMC).

This book is instrumental in shaping my view of ML models not just as function approximators, but as probabilistic systems that handle uncertainty.
