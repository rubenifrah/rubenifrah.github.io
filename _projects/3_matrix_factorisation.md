This project explores **Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)**, a scalable probabilistic model for collaborative filtering. The goal is to predict user preferences for items (e.g., movies, products) based on sparse historical data.



The report details the mathematical formulation of PMF, its implementation, and evaluation on standard datasets. It discusses the advantages of the probabilistic approach in handling large, sparse datasets compared to traditional methods.
