This project investigates the vulnerability of computer vision models to **adversarial attacks** and explores defense strategies. Adversarial examples are inputs designed to cause the model to make a mistake, often imperceptible to humans.



The report analyzes different attack methods (e.g., FGSM, PGD) and evaluates the effectiveness of defense mechanisms such as adversarial training. It highlights the importance of robustness in deploying safety-critical computer vision systems.
