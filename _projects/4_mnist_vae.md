This project implements a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** to generate handwritten digits similar to the MNIST dataset. VAEs are a powerful class of generative models that learn a continuous latent representation of the data.



The report covers the theory behind VAEs, including the reparameterization trick and the ELBO loss function. It demonstrates the model's ability to generate new, realistic digits and interpolate between them in the latent space.
