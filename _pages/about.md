I am a graduate student in the **M2 IASD (Artificial Intelligence, Systems, and Data)** program within the PSL ecosystem (**Dauphine - ENS Ulm - Mines Paris**), and an alumnus of **École Polytechnique** (X21). 

My academic background is built on a dual foundation: the mathematical and physical rigor from my engineering training at Polytechnique (specializing in **Mechanics & Physics**), and the theoretical depth of modern Machine Learning from the IASD Master (Optimization, Probabilistic Models, Deep Learning).

### Research Interests

My research interest focuses on **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Computer Vision**. I am driven by the challenge of building autonomous agents that can perceive complex, high-dimensional environments and make robust decisions.

I am currently working on projects at the intersection of **Visual Representation Learning** and **Control**, exploring how agents can learn efficient policies directly from pixels. My specific interests include:

* **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** Investigation of sample efficiency, exploration strategies, and model-based RL.
* **Computer Vision:** Learning useful representations for downstream control tasks (World Models, latent dynamics).
* **AI for Science:** Applying these general RL & CV advances to physical systems, with a focus on **Physics-Informed Learning** and **Sim-to-Real** transfer for robotics and complex dynamics.

I am actively looking for a **PhD position** starting **Fall 2025** in Switzerland or France.

Previously, I conducted research on stochastic filtering at **MBDA** and statistical modeling at the **University of Valencia**.
