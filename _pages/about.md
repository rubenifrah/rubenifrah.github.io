I am a Master's student in **Artificial Intelligence, Systems, and Data (IASD)** at **Dauphine-PSL**, and an alumnus of **École Polytechnique** (X21).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Physical Sciences** (AI for Science). I am particularly interested in:
* **Physics-Informed RL:** Integrating conservation laws (Hamiltonians, Lagrangians) into learning agents to improve sample efficiency.
* **Safe & Offline RL:** Controlling complex dynamics (e.g., Tokamaks, Robotics) where real-world exploration is costly or dangerous.

I am currently looking for a **PhD position** starting Fall 2025 in Switzerland or France.

Earlier, I worked as a Research Intern at **MBDA** (stochastic optimization) and at the **University of Valencia**.
