        Thoughout my academic path, I've realised that knowledge had three foundations: 
        <ul>
            <li>academic courses</li>
            <li>hands on projects</li>
            <li>personal reading and research</li>
        </ul>
        The first two pillars are described in the <a href="/coursework/">Coursework</a> and <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> pages. Thus, here is my attempt at representing the third foundation and talk about the books on Machine Learning that I have read, am reading or plan to read.
